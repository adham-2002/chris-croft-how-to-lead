            <h2>Leadership vs. Management ‚Äî The Captain Story</h2>
            <h3>The story</h3>
            <p>
              You board a cruise ship. The captain personally greets passengers
              by name, leaves personalized tags on pillows, serves soup at
              dinner, and even shovels coal in the engine room when the stoker
              is sick. Admirable energy ‚Äî but the bridge is empty and the ship
              drifts toward icebergs until the captain rushes back to steer her
              clear. Heroic, yes ‚Äî but risky leadership.
            </p>
            <p>
              What you really want is a captain on the bridge: delegating,
              designing systems, and keeping the big picture in view ‚Äî not doing
              every job personally.
            </p>
            <h3>Key lessons</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Management isn‚Äôt doing everyone else‚Äôs job; it‚Äôs ensuring
                everything gets done.
              </li>
              <li>
                Build a ‚Äúmachine of people‚Äù with training, QA, and traceability
                so quality issues are caught and fixed.
              </li>
              <li>
                A leader‚Äôs core responsibilities:
                <ul>
                  <li>People: right roles, motivation, accountability.</li>
                  <li>
                    Systems: processes, QA, error correction, continuous
                    improvement.
                  </li>
                  <li>Vision: direction and when to change people/systems.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                If things go wrong (salty soup, bad bed), it‚Äôs ultimately the
                leader‚Äôs responsibility: selection, training, systems, checks.
              </li>
              <li>
                A good manager can step away briefly and the organisation still
                runs ‚Äî thanks to delegation and robust systems.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Q&A</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Why memorize names and add pillow tags? To show care ‚Äî but the
                real test is whether a system (training/QA) ensures it without
                the captain doing it all.
              </li>
              <li>
                Why is serving soup/boiler work a problem? It steals time from
                planning, systems, and oversight.
              </li>
              <li>
                Does saving the ship prove great leadership? Courage, yes ‚Äî but
                great leadership prevents constant heroics.
              </li>
              <li>
                What is a ‚Äúmachine of people‚Äù? A designed org where roles,
                training, and accountability deliver reliable results.
              </li>
              <li>
                What happens if the captain disappears? Systems keep things
                steady short-term; without vision, problems emerge over time.
              </li>

            <h2>Is Everything Management‚Äôs Fault? ‚Äî Train Accident Story</h2>
            <h3>The story</h3>
            <p>
              After a fatal UK train crash, blame initially fell on a worker who
              left early on Friday. But supervisors allowed a culture of leaving
              early; the depot manager set the tone; the national manager should
              have detected the depot‚Äôs performance issues. Accountability
              climbs the chain.
            </p>
            <h3>Key lessons</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Individuals own their choices, but systems and culture are
                management‚Äôs job.
              </li>
              <li>
                Managers are responsible for people, processes, and monitoring.
              </li>
              <li>
                CEOs are responsible for everything overall; each manager for
                their area.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Q&A</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Is the worker entirely to blame? No ‚Äî the culture allowed it; he
                didn‚Äôt expect catastrophe.
              </li>
              <li>
                What about the supervisor? Permitted or failed to notice ‚Äî
                partly at fault.

            <h2>Monitoring Systems ‚Äî MBWA & Back to the Floor</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Leaders can‚Äôt do everything. Delegate, set up systems, then
              monitor them. Two practical methods:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Management by Walking Around (MBWA)</li>
              <li>Back to the Floor</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>MBWA</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Be physically present; spend ~1‚Äì2 hours daily walking around and
                talking with staff.
              </li>
              <li>During tough times, increase communication, don‚Äôt cut it.</li>
              <li>Ratio guideline: 25% speaking, 75% listening.</li>
              <li>
                Ask what people are doing, check progress, hear problems, share
                updates.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use MBWA to verify the information cascade actually reaches the
                frontline.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Back to the Floor</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Periodically do the lowest-level job to understand real
                constraints.
              </li>
              <li>Don‚Äôt go undercover ‚Äî be open about learning.</li>
              <li>
                Benefits: credibility, empathy, and better decisions (staffing,
                equipment, pricing).
              </li>
              <li>
                Prevents senior leaders from drifting above reality when middle
                managers report only ‚Äúgood news.‚Äù
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Q&A</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                What must leaders do after delegating? Monitor systems and
                people.
              </li>
              <li>Why MBWA? Direct contact checks health of work and comms.</li>
              <li>
                Why Back to the Floor? Reconnects leaders with the truth and
                earns respect.

            <h2>Communication in Leadership ‚Äî 5 Key Methods</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Communication is the wiring of leadership. Great leaders combine
              five channels to keep teams informed, aligned, and motivated.
            </p>
            <h3>The five methods</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Management by Walking Around (MBWA) ‚Äî be present and listen.
              </li>
              <li>
                Returning to the ground ‚Äî keep close to reality, repeatedly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Information cascade ‚Äî managers ‚Üí supervisors ‚Üí frontline; design
                formal routines if needed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Team meetings ‚Äî short weekly meetings; every leader attends two:
                with their team, and with boss + peers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Annual whole-company address ‚Äî share results and the plan for
                next year; builds trust and belonging.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Q&A</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Why is this powerful? Scale, trust (profits reinvested), and
                inspiration.
              </li>
              <li>
                What fails under pressure? Communication ‚Äî don‚Äôt cut it; double
                down.
              </li>
              <li>
                A helpful quote: ‚ÄúThe essence of leadership is to be the one who

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              John Adair (military background) shifted thinking from traits to
              actions: leadership is what you do. Two key frameworks:

            <h3>1) Three-circle model (Action-Centred Leadership)</h3>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Communication is not an optional ‚Äúextra‚Äù ‚Äî it is leadership.

            <h3>2) Five stages of leadership</h3>

              Leadership runs in a cycle; at each stage think about task, team,

            <h2>Motivation ‚Äî Maslow‚Äôs Hierarchy of Needs</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Maslow proposed that human motivation follows a hierarchy of five
              levels, built from the bottom up. He began by studying happiness;
              the model was later applied at work. It‚Äôs simple but powerful:
              people focus on lower needs first; only when those are met do
              higher needs motivate.
            </p>
            <h3>The five levels</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Physiological (Survival) ‚Äî Food, water, shelter, rest. If you‚Äôre
                cold or hungry, you can‚Äôt focus on anything else.
              </li>
              <li>
                Safety (Security) ‚Äî Stability, safety nets, predictability. In
                ‚Äúthe jungle,‚Äù you‚Äôd fence your cave, store food, find a second
                river. At work, it‚Äôs job security, fair rules, consistent
                management.
              </li>
              <li>
                Belonging (Social) ‚Äî Being part of a team, friendships,
                inclusion. Humans are social; solitary confinement shows how
                deeply we need connection.
              </li>
              <li>
                Esteem (Status/Ego) ‚Äî Recognition, respect, feeling valued and
                capable. Examples include ‚ÄúTypist of the Week,‚Äù job titles,
                owning an area. Culture matters: some celebrate visible success;
                others prefer subtle recognition.
              </li>
              <li>
                Self-actualization ‚Äî Becoming the best version of yourself;
                meaningful work and mastery. A bricklayer can point at a
                building and say, ‚ÄúI made that.‚Äù It‚Äôs an internal motivator.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Note on exceptions: Rare individuals (e.g., Van Gogh) may pursue
              self-actualization without the lower layers. For most people,
              removing security undermines everything above it.
            </p>
            <h3>Leadership actions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Ensure security first:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Communicate frequently (big picture + personal feedback).
                  </li>
                  <li>Set clear rules; be fair and consistent daily.</li>
                  <li>
                    Offer support and training when people struggle; don‚Äôt
                    weaponize insecurity.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Build belonging:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Hold short weekly team meetings; create welcoming shared
                    spaces (coffee areas).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Provide small perks (e.g., free basics) and occasional
                    social events.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Meet esteem needs:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Recognize contributions publicly and privately; give
                    ownership (‚Äúthis is your area‚Äù).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Use meaningful titles or responsibilities; spend time with
                    people ‚Äî attention signals value.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Enable self-actualization:
                <ul>
                  <li>Train and upskill; provide challenges and autonomy.</li>
                  <li>
                    Let people help set objectives; trust them with important
                    work.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Q&A</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                What are the five levels? Physiological, Safety, Belonging,
                Esteem, Self-actualization.
              </li>
              <li>
                Why is security before social? Without security, people focus on
                survival and protect themselves, harming teamwork.
              </li>
              <li>
                What policies damage security? Firing the ‚Äúbottom 10%‚Äù yearly;
                inconsistent rules; volatile, moody leadership.
              </li>
              <li>
                How do you build belonging? Team rituals, open spaces, inclusive
                meetings, light social events.
              </li>
              <li>
                What fulfills esteem needs? Recognition, responsibility, visible
                wins, time with the boss, clear ownership.
              </li>

            <h2>Recognition & Performance ‚Äî The Management Potato</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              ‚ÄúThanking‚Äù (recognition) is a powerful motivator that cuts across
              Maslow‚Äôs layers: it reinforces security, belonging, esteem, and
              even self-actualization by confirming impact. The Management
              Potato is a simple way to think about performance and feedback.
            </p>
            <h3>The potato model</h3>
            <p>Each person‚Äôs performance has:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Normal work (‚úì)</li>
              <li>Areas of excellence (‚úì‚úì)</li>
              <li>One or more weak spots (√ó)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Managers often fixate on the √ó and overlook the ‚úì‚úì. Over time,
              that shrinks motivation and output.
            </p>
            <h3>Why focusing on negatives backfires</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                People feel unappreciated and reduce effort on their strong
                areas (no thanks given).
              </li>
              <li>
                They avoid the criticized area entirely to dodge more pain.
              </li>
              <li>
                Overall performance ‚Äúpotato‚Äù shrivels to a ‚Äúprune‚Äù ‚Äî the person
                goes through the motions.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What to do instead</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Amplify strengths (‚úì‚úì)
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Give specific, timely thanks. Name the action and the
                    impact. Then stop ‚Äî don‚Äôt ‚Äúbut‚Äù it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Create more chances to use strengths; make wins visible
                    (demos, changelogs, shout-outs).
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Coach the gap (√ó) supportively
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Ask: ‚ÄúDo you know what you‚Äôll do differently next time?‚Äù If
                    yes, endorse; if no, coach.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Offer help, pair on the next attempt, and own the risk: ‚ÄúIf
                    it goes wrong, it‚Äôs on me.‚Äù
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Keep tone future-focused and confident: ‚ÄúYou can learn
                    this.‚Äù
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Separate praise from improvement
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Praise: pure ‚úì‚úì (no ‚Äúpity about‚Ä¶‚Äù). Short, specific,
                    unqualified.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Improvement: a dedicated conversation ‚Äî start with overall
                    confidence, then discuss the one area, end with support and
                    belief (good ‚Üí improvement ‚Üí good) Feedback Sandwich.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Avoid the ‚Äúeverything in one sandwich‚Äù
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Mixing praise and critique in one chat averages to negative.
                    Split them.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Q&A</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Where does thanking fit in Maslow? Security, belonging, esteem ‚Äî
                and it reinforces self-actualization by confirming impact.
              </li>
              <li>
                Isn‚Äôt it natural to focus on problems? Yes, but it‚Äôs
                counterproductive. Balance by over-indexing on strengths and
                coaching gaps.
              </li>
              <li>
                How specific should praise be? Very: action + impact (who
                benefited, what changed).
              </li>
              <li>
                How to address repeated mistakes? Co-create a plan, provide
                practice reps, and inspect outcomes; escalate only after fair
                support.

            <h2>Personality-based Motivation ‚Äî Four Types</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Maslow explains what people generally need; personalities explain
              how much they prioritize each need and how they like to be led. A
              simple, practical model uses two axes to get four common types.
              Adapting your style makes motivation stick.
            </p>
            <h3>The two axes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Horizontal: Quiet/careful ‚Üí Outgoing/dynamic (introversion ‚Üî
                extroversion)
              </li>
              <li>
                Vertical: Logical/reason-led ‚Üí Emotional/people-led (thinking ‚Üî
                feeling)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This yields four quadrants: Analytical (top-left), Controller
              (top-right), Enthusiast (bottom-right), Amiable (bottom-left).
            </p>
            <h3>Quick-reference matrix</h3>
            <table>
              <thead>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Values: security, clarity, fairness, expertise,
                    self-actualization via mastery.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Watchouts: may avoid risk, prefer 1:1 over big-stage comms.

              </li>

                  <li>
                    Values: status to act, autonomy, tough challenges, impact

                  <li>
                    Watchouts: can skip detail, low patience; risks leaving

                  <li>
                    Watchouts: can be disorganised, budget-blind, mood-driven;

                    Values: belonging, care, stability, clear why behind

                  <li>
                    Watchouts: may avoid conflict and risk; needs time and

                  <li>
                    Offer deep problems and time for quality; praise expertise

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Check critical details and risks at gates; ask for crisp

                    Paint an exciting vision; give stage time (demos, launches)
                    and visible recognition; assign creative work.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Add guardrails: budget checks, deadlines, an ops partner;
                    watch energy dips and support consistency.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Build trust 1:1; explain the why; create safe, predictable
                    routines; emphasize team rituals.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Invite input; co-create change plans; reassure during risk;

            <ul>
              <li>
                Analytical: fair, organised, strong planners/communicators 1:1;
                work on vision and bolder bets.
              </li>
              <li>
                Controller: dynamic, front-led; solve on the fly; must practice
                empathy and pace for others.
              </li>
              <li>
                Enthusiast: inspirational visionary; pair with an analytical for
                detail/continuity; avoid flavor-of-month churn.
              </li>
              <li>
                Amiable: people-savvy senior manager; excels at talent placement
                and harmony; may not self-promote for the top job.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Q&A</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Why adapt style at all? Same needs, different preferences.
                Matching style accelerates trust and performance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Can people be a mix? Yes; this is a heuristic. Default to the
                dominant style but adapt to context.
              </li>
              <li>
                How to identify quickly? Notice decision lens (data vs. people)
                and energy (quiet vs. assertive). Ask how they prefer feedback
                and planning.
              </li>
              <li>
                Do people change? Under stress, styles can shift; revisit
                preferences periodically.

            <h2>Is Money a Motivator? ‚Äî Key Insights</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Money matters for security and status, but beyond a certain
              threshold it rarely creates lasting motivation. It ‚Äúpushes‚Äù
              behaviour without generating genuine desire for the work. Real,
              sustained performance comes from meaning, growth, challenge,
              belonging, pride, and impact.
            </p>
            <h3>Push vs. Pull Motivation</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Push motivator:</strong> Money can make you do a task
                (drive to Scotland for ¬£1,000) but doesn‚Äôt make you
                <em>want</em> the task itself.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Pull motivator:</strong> Interest, purpose, belief in
                the product, challenge, mastery ‚Äî these make you
                <em>want</em> to do the task.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you need to pay extra to get someone to do it, they may infer
                the task itself has little intrinsic value.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Where Money Fits in Maslow</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Supports <strong>Security</strong> (survival + safety) and
                sometimes <strong>Status/Esteem</strong> (symbolism, not the
                cash itself).
              </li>
              <li>
                Not part of <strong>Self-actualization</strong> ‚Äî that‚Äôs about
                growth, contribution, creativity, mastery.
              </li>

                People often chase the <em>status signal</em> money conveys, not
                the raw currency.

            <h3>Hygiene Factor Logic</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Below a fair baseline: low pay actively
                <em>demotivates</em> (stress, distraction, resentment).
              </li>
              <li>Pay cuts hurt motivation sharply.</li>
              <li>
                Pay rises help briefly; the lasting spark is usually the
                <em>recognition implied</em> (‚ÄúThey value me‚Äù). A silent deposit
                = weak effect.

              </li>

              <li>
                Are you staying mainly for pay while caring little about impact?

            <h3>Leadership Actions (What To Do Instead)</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Set a Fair Floor:</strong> Ensure baseline compensation
                removes anxiety (security first). Revisit only when market or
                role scope changes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Decouple Recognition from Cash:</strong> Pair raises
                with explicit, specific praise; use frequent non-monetary
                recognition (storytelling, visibility, ownership).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Design Meaning:</strong> Tie tasks to customer outcomes;
                share real user stories; let people see the ‚ÄúScotland is
                brilliant‚Äù side, not just the miles.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Enable Mastery:</strong> Provide stretch goals, feedback
                loops, skill coaching, autonomy with accountability.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Show Progress:</strong> Use metrics that reflect
                improvement (learning velocity, quality gains) ‚Äî not just raw
                output.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Guard Against Pay Gamification:</strong> Avoid purely
                individual high-variance incentive schemes for
                collaborative/creative work; blend team + quality signals.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Normalize Doing Your Best:</strong> Culturally reject
                ‚ÄúI‚Äôd try harder if‚Ä¶‚Äù narratives; celebrate craftsmanship as
                identity.
              </li>

            <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
            <p>
              Money prevents dissatisfaction and can accelerate simple output,
              but genuine motivation is powered by purpose, mastery,
              recognition, belonging, progress, and impact. If discretionary
              effort depends on extra cash, the underlying motivators are
              missing ‚Äî fix <em>those</em>, not just the payslip.
            </p>
            <h3>One-Line Summary</h3>
            <p>
              Use money to remove friction ‚Äî use meaning, mastery, and
              recognition to unlock performance.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Isn‚Äôt this too much to track? Treat it like a rotating
                dashboard‚Äîscan 3‚Äì5 items per week.
              </li>
              <li>
                What if I can‚Äôt do all 20 now? Prioritize Security (6,18),
                Belonging (16), Growth (3,11,13), Recognition (7,8).
              </li>
              <li>
                How do I start? Run a ‚Äúmotivation audit‚Äù meeting with yourself:
                list team, note gaps per item, pick 3 interventions.
              </li>
              <li>
                How to measure impact? Watch retention, discretionary effort,
                initiative volume, learning velocity, quality metrics.
              </li>
              <li>
                How to delegate? Assign ‚Äúchampions‚Äù (e.g., Learning, Belonging,
                Recognition) to foster distributed ownership.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Implementation micro-playbook</h3>
            <p>
              Week 1: Audit ownership (1), assign missing; schedule appraisals
              (5); add learning column to 1:1 doc (11). Week 2: Introduce weekly
              recognition snippet in standup (7/8); identify stretch for each
              dev (3); document roles (6). Week 3: Draft development pathways
              (13); run style preference pulse (10); social ritual refresh (16).
              Week 4: Talent review (14); fairness policy clarity mail (19);
              leader self-video to model positivity (20).
            </p>
            <p>
              Then iterate monthly: rotate focus; retire solved friction;
              elevate new challenges.

              Leadership Styles ‚Äî Tannenbaum &amp; Schmidt Continuum (Extended)
            </h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Leadership style is largely a question of how much
              <strong>decision control</strong> you retain versus pass to
              others. Tannenbaum &amp; Schmidt described a continuum from fully
              leader-directed to fully team-directed. We extend it with two
              additional end-states (Empower vs. Abdicate) and highlight impacts
              on Control, Motivation, Time, and Quality.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Tell:</strong> Emergencies; compliance-critical tasks
                where deviation is dangerous; novice in high-risk context.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Sell:</strong> Need quick alignment plus mild morale
                boost; introducing an unpopular but necessary decision.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Consult:</strong> You have draft expertise but want
                risks surfaced; moderate time available; building buy-in.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Share:</strong> Strategic / ambiguous problems; need
                diversity of perspectives; culture-building moments.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Delegate:</strong> Clear outcome, capable people,
                development &amp; time leverage goals; you still need
                visibility.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Empower:</strong> Mature, high-trust team; domain
                expertise exceeds yours; innovation speed matters; risk of
                over-monitoring &gt; under.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Abdicate (Avoid):</strong> Signals you don‚Äôt care;
                raises failure odds; erodes security &amp; accountability.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
              <li>
                What is the consequence of a wrong decision? (High ‚Üí move left;
                low ‚Üí can move right.)
              </li>
              <li>Do they have proven capability here? (Yes ‚Üí shift right.)</li>
              <li>
                Is speed of <em>this</em> decision more critical than long-term
                development? (Yes ‚Üí left bias.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Is buy-in essential for execution quality? (Yes ‚Üí
                consult/share/delegate.)
              </li>
              <li>

                empower with safety nets.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Are you at risk of heroics (Captain story)? (Yes ‚Üí push right.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Can you implement minimal monitoring without bottlenecking? (If
                no, either empower suitable people or rescope.)

                self-actualization blocked).
              </li>
              <li>
                Faux Consult (already decided) ‚Üí cynicism; future silence.
              </li>
              <li>Endless Share ‚Üí decision paralysis; schedule slip.</li>
              <li>
                Delegate without checkpoints ‚Üí drifts toward hidden failure
                (confused with empower).
              </li>
              <li>
                Empower without explicit ‚Äúask for help‚Äù expectation ‚Üí accidental
                abdication.
              </li>
              <li>
                Abdicate + later blame ‚Üí destroys psychological safety and
                trust.
              </li>

              <li>

                knowledge).
              </li>
              <li>
                Decide minimum style giving sufficient safety + maximum
                development.
              </li>
              <li>
                Set clarity: outcome, constraints, decision boundaries, check
                cadence (unless empowering).
              </li>
              <li>
                Communicate style explicitly: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm delegating (monitoring at

            <h3>Linking to other frameworks</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Adair:</strong> Style impacts how you balance Task
                control vs. Team involvement vs. Individual growth.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Maslow:</strong> Moving right increases
                esteem/self-actualization (autonomy, mastery); ensure Security
                first.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Management Potato:</strong> Positive recognition

              <li>
                <strong>Money motivator section:</strong> Autonomy &amp; trust
                outperform extrinsic push for creative work.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Applied Scenarios:</strong> Scenario 13 (dependence) ‚Üí

                re-expand.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Delegate:</strong> You monitor progress
                (daily/weekly/milestone checks) AND provide support when they
                need help. This is the safest high-autonomy style.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Empower:</strong> You don't monitor because you trust
                them completely, BUT you remain available for support if they
                ask. They must proactively reach out.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Abdicate:</strong> No monitoring, no support‚Äîyou're
                absent and don't care. Always destructive.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Seagull Management:</strong> You monitor (notice
                problems) but provide no support‚Äîjust fly in, criticize ("that's
                no good, buck your ideas up"), and leave. Also destructive.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>The choice is between Delegate and Empower.</strong> Never
              use Abdicate or Seagull styles.

            <h3>One-line takeaway</h3>
            <p>
              Select the <em>lightest</em> control style that still protects
              quality and safety‚Äîthen earn the right to move further right
              through capability building and clear systems.

              <li>"This is where I think"</li>
              <li>"I delegate everything. I've got a really good team"</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>No More Weekly Reports</h3>
            <p><strong>The old way:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Factory manager wrote a weekly report</li>
              <li>Took him 1 hour to write</li>
              <li>Took Malcolm 30 minutes to read</li>
              <li>Numbers: tonnes made, waste, profit, overtime</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What Malcolm said:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>"Why are you bringing me this?"</li>
              <li>"I trust you - don't write the report anymore"</li>
              <li>"If there's a problem you can fix, just fix it"</li>
              <li>"If you can't fix it, come see me and I'll help"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Result:</strong> Manager never wrote the report again.
            </p>
            <h3>Car Policy Revolution</h3>
            <p><strong>Old rules:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Strict list of allowed cars</li>
              <li>Had to be four-seater</li>
              <li>Sunroof only if you hit targets</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What Malcolm did:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Tore up the list in front of everyone</li>
              <li>"Get whatever you like, whatever's sensible"</li>
              <li>"It's up to you"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What happened:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Most got practical Mondeo diesels</li>
              <li>One guy got his dream BMW</li>
              <li>BMW guy volunteered for all long drives</li>
              <li>Everyone was happy</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Expense Forms Made Simple</h3>
            <p><strong>Malcolm's problem:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Spent 30 minutes weekly signing expenses</li>
              <li>Always approved them anyway</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>His solution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Photocopied his signature onto blank forms</li>
              <li>"I'm not checking anymore - I trust you"</li>
              <li>"Fill it in, send to accounts, get paid"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>His attitude:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>"Maybe someone adds ¬£10 for flowers for their wife"</li>
              <li>"Who cares? Maybe she deserves flowers"</li>
              <li>"It's worth ¬£10 if it motivates everyone"</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Flexible Time and Holidays</h3>
            <p><strong>Time:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>No clocking in</li>
              <li>"Work whatever hours you need to do the job"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Holidays:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>No counting days</li>
              <li>"Do whatever's sensible"</li>
              <li>"Longer holiday this year, shorter next year - up to you"</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Holiday Money Lesson</h3>
            <p><strong>The story:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Friend took kids to France</li>
              <li>Kids kept asking: "Can we have ice cream? Chocolate?"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The experiment:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Day 1: "Here's ¬£200 for all of us"</li>
              <li>"You can blow it all today if you want"</li>
              <li>"But when it's gone, it's gone"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What the kids did:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Made a budget immediately</li>
              <li>Divided money for ice cream, chocolate, dad's wine</li>
              <li>Calculated daily spending limits</li>
              <li>Became "little accountants"</li>
              <li>Even told dad: "No more wine - you had two yesterday"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Came back with money left over.</p>
            <h3>Why It Works</h3>
            <p><strong>Trust creates ownership:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Salespeople didn't buy Ferraris</li>
              <li>They thought: "That's our company's money"</li>
              <li>Kids looked after the holiday money because it was theirs</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Trust makes people trustworthy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>When you trust someone completely</li>
              <li>They usually become more trustworthy</li>
              <li>Not less trustworthy</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How to Know Who to Trust</h3>
            <p><strong>Malcolm's way:</strong> "I can just tell"</p>
            <p><strong>Safer way:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Start with delegation (monitor them)</li>
              <li>Watch how they do for months or years</li>
              <li>If they're brilliant, tell them:</li>
              <li>"You've been doing this job brilliantly"</li>
              <li>"I totally trust you - no more monitoring"</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Big Picture</h3>
            <p><strong>What empowerment teaches us:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>If people can handle zero monitoring</li>
              <li>Then monitoring them (delegation) is very safe</li>
              <li>Trust leads to ownership</li>
              <li>Ownership makes people care more</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Delegate? ‚Äî Six Key Advantages</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Why would you want to delegate work to other people or possibly
              empower them? Here are six clear advantages that make delegation
              worth doing.
            </p>
            <h3>The Six Advantages</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Motivation</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>People love to be given things to do</li>
              <li>
                Their first reaction might be "Oh, I've been given this job"
              </li>
              <li>
                But they get satisfaction from achievement and overcoming
                challenges
              </li>
              <li>This is the first reason for delegating</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. Better Quality Work</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You may get better quality work than if you were doing it
                yourself
              </li>
              <li>Sometimes people will do it better than you</li>
              <li>You might think "I wouldn't have done it like that"</li>
              <li>
                But their way could be just as good as yours, if not better
              </li>
              <li>What you find trivial and boring, they might love</li>
              <li>They may do a better job than you</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>3. Learning Opportunities</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>They can learn from the work</li>
              <li>Everybody needs learning in their job for motivation</li>
              <li>Delegating is a way to get people to learn</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>4. Your Time</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>It's obviously quicker to give work to other people</li>
              <li>It takes time to explain it at first</li>
              <li>But it's worth it because you save time in the end</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>5. Spread the Risk</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>If something happens to you, others can handle it</li>
              <li>If the one person who knows how to do it is unavailable</li>
              <li>Having delegated to a third person means backup</li>
              <li>
                If somebody leaves, is ill, or too busy - you have other people
                who can do it
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>6. Frees You for Promotion</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The more you can delegate, the better</li>
              <li>
                Some people worry their boss will think they're not doing
                anything
              </li>
              <li>This is a ridiculous fear</li>
              <li>
                The only way you can be promoted is if other people can do your
                current job
              </li>
              <li>
                You don't want to be indispensable or you can never be promoted
              </li>
              <li>Consider delegating as much as you can</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key Insights</h3>
            <p><strong>The promotion paradox:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Being indispensable = being stuck</li>
              <li>Teaching others your job = opening your path upward</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Quality surprise:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>What you find boring, others might find exciting</li>
              <li>Different people bring different strengths</li>
              <li>"Not my way" doesn't mean "wrong way"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Time investment:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Explaining takes time upfront</li>
              <li>But saves much more time long-term</li>
              <li>Think weeks/months ahead, not just today</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>
              Objections to Delegating ‚Äî Common Barriers &amp; Why They're False
            </h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              You hear all sorts of objections to delegating - barriers and
              excuses for why people don't delegate. But every objection to
              delegating is actually false. Here's why.
            </p>
            <h3>Common Objections</h3>
            <p><strong>"It might go wrong" (Fear of failure)</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The real reason people don't delegate is fear that it will go
                wrong
              </li>
              <li>
                This is unfounded - if you're monitoring and ready to step in
                and support, it can't go wrong
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>"They might become better than me"</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Fear that people who work for you will become better than you
              </li>
              <li>This is ridiculous - we want them to be better than us</li>
              <li>
                Don't fear "They might do it better than me, I might look bad"
              </li>
              <li>
                If you've got people doing a brilliant job for you, you will
                look good as their leader
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>"I'm too busy to explain it"</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>This might be true if you're in a desperate hurry</li>
              <li>
                But if you can find time to explain it, it pays off many times
                over
              </li>
              <li>They'll do it for you next time and the time after</li>
              <li>"Haven't got time to teach them" is ridiculous</li>
              <li>
                If you're so busy you don't have time to explain, it shows you
                should have delegated other stuff
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>"It's fun" or "I'm the best at it"</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>It is fun to go back to doing what you used to do</li>
              <li>
                It's probably true you're the best at it - that's why you were
                made the boss
              </li>
              <li>But you have to let that go</li>
              <li>
                Delegate to people who may not be as brilliant as you, but
                they'll learn over time
              </li>
              <li>
                How can they ever be as good as you if you don't give it to
                them?
              </li>
              <li>Management isn't necessarily about fun</li>
              <li>You've got to teach them to be as good as you</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>"I might run out of work"</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>This is ridiculous</li>
              <li>
                You can always have more time for thinking about vision,
                improving systems, and improving people
              </li>
              <li>You will never delegate yourself out of work</li>
              <li>
                If your boss thinks having time to think (rather than running
                around firefighting) means you haven't got enough to do, then
                your boss is stupid
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The "Too Busy" Myth</h3>
            <p><strong>"My people are too busy"</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                "I can't delegate because my people are already 100% occupied"
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The hidden capacity experiment:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Suppose they're 90% occupied</li>
              <li>
                Will they sit around doing nothing for 10% of the time in front
                of you? No
              </li>
              <li>They're always going to look busy when you're there</li>
              <li>
                What they actually do: slow down slightly (less efficient) OR
                put quality up
              </li>
              <li>Either efficiency down or quality up</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Thought experiment:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>You have 10 people, perfectly fully used</li>
              <li>Due to admin error, you get an 11th person</li>
              <li>Suddenly everybody has 10% spare time</li>
              <li>
                What happens? They improve quality a little and become slightly
                less efficient
              </li>
              <li>Now they all look busy again</li>
              <li>
                There's 10% slack hidden by increased quality and reduced
                efficiency
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The test:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When people look busy, how do you know there isn't spare
                capacity hidden by over-quality and under-efficiency?
              </li>
              <li>Only way to find out: try it</li>
              <li>Give them one more thing - bet they'll fit it in</li>
              <li>
                Example: If George Clooney and Kylie Minogue were dancing
                outside and you said "You can watch only if you still do your
                work" - they would still do their work
              </li>
              <li>They can always fit in one more thing</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Every objection is false:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Whatever your pet objection is, it's probably false</li>
              <li>Try delegating more than you normally would</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The time calculation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Delegate just one more hour a week = 50 hours a year</li>
              <li>That's an extra working week</li>
              <li>
                Not a normal week with interruptions - pure time for vision and
                strategy
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Management reality:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Delegating is the number one management skill</li>
              <li>
                If a manager says they're too busy, first question: Do they
                delegate enough?
              </li>
              <li>You absolutely must get better at delegating</li>

            <h2>Would You Be Missed? ‚Äî Nick's Motorbike Crash Story</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              This is the first of two stories about delegation. It shows what
              happens when someone who thinks they're indispensable is suddenly
              forced out of the picture.
            </p>
            <h3>The Story</h3>
            <p><strong>Nick's company:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Nick runs a company with about 10 people</li>
              <li>Small company, but Nick is the centre of everything.</li>
              <li>According to Nick, all 10 people are "useless"</li>
              <li>
                Nick does most of the selling, decides prices, develops new
                products
              </li>
              <li>He's "the heart of the company"</li>
              <li>Everyone else just does little jobs for him</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The accident:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Nick was coming home from work on his motorbike</li>
              <li>A tractor dumped manure on the road by mistake</li>
              <li>Nick skidded on the manure</li>
              <li>
                A lady in a car swerved to miss the motorbike but ran over Nick
              </li>
              <li>Nick woke up in intensive care</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The injuries:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Both arms broken, both legs broken, pelvis broken</li>
              <li>Shouldn't really have survived</li>
              <li>Would be out for a whole year before he could walk</li>
              <li>
                Got lots of metal implants - can't go through airports anymore
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What Happened</h3>
            <p><strong>The expectation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Everyone thought his company would fall apart</li>
              <li>Nick was the key guy - this should be a disaster</li>
              <li>Those "ten useless people" would surely ruin everything</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The reality:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The ten "useless" people had their best year ever without Nick
              </li>
              <li>They ran the company perfectly fine for a whole year</li>
              <li>Performance was better than when Nick was there</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>When Nick returned:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Performance went back down again</li>
              <li>
                Nick's explanation: "It was just the way the market was that
                year"
              </li>
              <li>
                He refused to see it as a sign that he should delegate more
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key Insights</h3>
            <p><strong>The delegation test:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Nick's forced absence proved his people weren't useless at all
              </li>
              <li>They could run the company without him</li>
              <li>
                The crash was like "a big finger coming down from heaven saying
                delegate more"
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The imaginary crash exercise:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>You don't need an actual motorbike crash</li>
              <li>Come into work and think: "What if I wasn't here?"</li>
              <li>Who would do all these jobs?</li>
              <li>Make a list of everything you do</li>
              <li>
                Think: "Who can I give this to? Who must I give this to if I'm
                not here?"
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The delegation opportunity:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If you delegated everything but were still there to catch them
                if they fall, that would be great
              </li>
              <li>
                They probably made some mistakes without Nick because they were
                suddenly dropped into running everything
              </li>
              <li>
                But imagine if you delegated, trusted them completely, AND were
                there to give support if necessary
              </li>
              <li>You'd do even better than Nick's company did</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The ultimate question:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your company could probably run without you too</li>
              <li>So why not delegate a whole load of stuff?</li>
              <li>Spend half your time on the golf course or sailing</li>
              <li>You could do it</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The wake-up call:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If your people can handle everything when you're forced out
              </li>
              <li>
                Why are you doing so much of their work when you're there?
              </li>
              <li>Being missed vs. being needed are very different things</li>

            <h2>The Cushion Story ‚Äî Death by a Thousand Cuts</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              This is the second delegating story. It shows how small, trivial
              decisions can completely overwhelm a leader and prevent them from
              focusing on what really matters.
            </p>
            <h3>The Story</h3>
            <p><strong>Toby's company:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Toby runs a big company in London (90 people)</li>
              <li>Does refurbishing of offices and buildings</li>
              <li>Very successful, very clever, very hard working</li>
              <li>Works really long hours and doesn't like it</li>
              <li>
                Too busy to attend his own managers' time management course
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The lunch visit:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>During a time management course for his managers</li>
              <li>Went to sit in Toby's office to eat lunch and catch up</li>
              <li>
                Couldn't get a word in because of constant stream of people
                asking trivial questions
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The cushion moment:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                One person came in with two cushions (slightly different shades
                of red)
              </li>
              <li>
                Asked: "Hey Toby, which colour should be used for the Vodafone
                job?"
              </li>
              <li>Toby said: "Oh, I'd go for that one"</li>
              <li>Person said: "Thanks, Toby" and left</li>
              <li>The whole thing took about a minute</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p><strong>"It only took a minute":</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Toby's defense: "Well, yeah, but it only took a minute"</li>
              <li>Reality: "It's death by a thousand cuts"</li>
              <li>
                Hundreds of people coming every day asking trivial questions
              </li>
              <li>
                Managing director choosing cushion colours instead of thinking
                about strategy
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How it started:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Probably months or years before, Toby told someone off: "What
                idiot chose that colour of cushion?"
              </li>
              <li>From then on, everything was brought to him for approval</li>
              <li>He made a rod for his own back</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Rewarding bad behaviour:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Every time they come to him, he gives an answer</li>
              <li>So they keep bringing him stuff</li>
              <li>He's training them to always ask him trivial questions</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p><strong>What he should say:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>"Why are you bringing me those cushions? You decide."</li>
              <li>Or more nicely: "Well, what do you think?"</li>
              <li>If they pick the right colour: "Brilliant, go with that"</li>
              <li>
                If they pick right 5 times in a row: "You don't need to bring
                them to me every time. Just do it."
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Systems and people:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>System option:</strong> Colour swatch agreed with
                customer at beginning, everyone compares cushions to the swatch.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>People option:</strong> Someone in charge of cushion
                colour choosing (not the MD), with ownership of that decision,
                everyone goes to them.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The ¬£800 offer:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Offered to follow Toby around for a day for ¬£800</li>
              <li>
                Every time he could delegate something: "You could have
                delegated that"
              </li>
              <li>Toby said no, but it would have been money well spent</li>
              <li>
                Would have forced him to delegate more and freed him from small
                stuff
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key Insights</h3>
            <p><strong>The Post-it note challenge:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Write "Could I delegate this?" on a Post-it note</li>
              <li>Hold it in your hand for the whole day</li>
              <li>Force yourself to ask the question constantly</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Manager vs. leader mindset:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Never again decide cushion colours</li>
              <li>Even though it's easy, even though you're great at it</li>
              <li>You've moved on - now you're a manager, a leader</li>
              <li>You shouldn't be doing trivia</li>

            <p><strong>The delegation progression:</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Someone brings you a decision</li>
              <li>Ask "What do you think?" instead of just deciding</li>
              <li>If they're right, confirm and praise</li>
              <li>After several correct decisions, delegate completely</li>
              <li>Free yourself for strategic thinking</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>"To know and not to do is to not know":</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>We all know we should delegate more</li>

              <li>
                Knowing isn't enough - you need systems to force the behaviour

            <h2>How to Delegate ‚Äî The 8-Step Process</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              You might think delegating is just saying "I'm delegating this job
              to you," but it's not that simple. Here's exactly how to delegate
              effectively with the right words and approach.
            </p>
            <h3>Key Principles</h3>
            <p><strong>The 80% rule:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Just because someone can't do it 100% as well as you doesn't
                mean you shouldn't delegate
              </li>
              <li>If they can do it 80% as well, give it to them</li>
              <li>
                That last 20% doesn't really matter (and is probably in your own
                mind)
              </li>
              <li>
                Exception: Brain transplants need to be 100%, but cushion colors
                are fine at 80%
              </li>
              <li>
                Even brain surgeons - at some point the new doctor has to be
                given the operation
              </li>
              <li>
                That 20% difference is often just "I wouldn't do it like that" -
                but their way is probably fine, maybe even better
              </li>
              <li>How will they get to 100%? They have to start somewhere</li>
              <li>
                If they're at 80%, hand it over - if you wait for 100%, you'll
                wait forever
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenge principle:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You have two people: Louise (experienced, can do it in her
                sleep) and Miles (new, will find it challenging)
              </li>
              <li>If it's an emergency, give it to Louise</li>
              <li>
                If you have time, give it to Miles - even though he'll need more
                supervision and take longer
              </li>
              <li>
                Miles learns, gets enjoyment from succeeding at a challenge,
                becomes happier
              </li>
              <li>
                You keep Louise in reserve for bigger, more difficult things
              </li>
              <li>
                Eventually Miles becomes as good as Louise, and Louise moves up
                too
              </li>
              <li>
                If you always give it to Louise: she's bored, Miles is bored =
                lose-lose
              </li>
              <li>
                Turn it around: Instead of "Who shall I give this job to?" ask
                "What can I give Miles/Louise that will challenge them?"
              </li>
              <li>Start with the person, not the job</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Eight Steps</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Say what you want (clearly)</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Be very clear about what the job actually is</li>
              <li>Don't assume they understand - spell it out</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. Say why it's important</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Big the job up a bit</li>
              <li>
                "I've got this really important job and I want you to do it"
              </li>
              <li>Make them feel good about being chosen</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>3. Say why you're giving it to them</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>"Because you're really good at doing this"</li>
              <li>Or "I want you to learn about this"</li>
              <li>
                Or "I want you to be our resident expert on this in the future"
              </li>
              <li>Give them a reason they're the chosen one</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>4. Set the limits</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Time limit: When do you need it?</li>
              <li>Money limit: How much can they spend?</li>
              <li>Tell them their budgets clearly</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>5. Define the reporting process</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>How much control will you keep?</li>
              <li>
                "Come and see me once a week to tell me how you're getting on"
              </li>
              <li>"Let's meet every morning for an update"</li>
              <li>"Email me when you've done the first part"</li>
              <li>Define the level of monitoring upfront</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>6. Make support available</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>"If there are any problems at all, do come and see me"</li>
              <li>
                "I will always be supportive if you come to me with problems"
              </li>
              <li>Make it clear there's no shame in asking for help</li>
              <li>
                You're giving them something new, big, and difficult - you're
                there to help
              </li>
              <li>
                For empowerment: they MUST come to you with problems (you won't
                know otherwise)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>7. Check they understand</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>"Are you okay with that? Do you understand?"</li>
              <li>What seems easy to you might be big and difficult to them</li>
              <li>
                Probe a bit: "So what's the first step you're going to take?"
              </li>
              <li>
                Check: Do they know how to do it? Do they want to do it? Are
                they happy with it?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>8. Give confidence</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>"You can do it"</li>
              <li>"I know it's going to be great"</li>
              <li>
                "I'm really looking forward to seeing you deliver a brilliant
                job on this"
              </li>
              <li>"It's going to be fine. You can do it."</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Personal Example</h3>
            <p><strong>The French universities disaster:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Boss delegated: "Improve links with French universities"</li>
              <li>Response: "I don't know where to even start"</li>
              <li>Result: Did nothing for two years, hoped he'd forget</li>
              <li>Each meeting: worried he'd ask about progress</li>
              <li>
                After two years at appraisal: "What happened with that French
                university thing?" Had to confess - nothing done
              </li>
              <li>
                Looking back: it was a great opportunity (excuse for trips to
                France, meetings with wine)
              </li>
              <li>
                The problem: Boss didn't check understanding or probe first
                steps
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What the boss should have done:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Step 7: "Are you happy with that? Do you know what you're going
                to do?"
              </li>
              <li>
                If vague response: "Okay, so what's the first step you're going
                to take?"
              </li>
              <li>
                Would have revealed the confusion and uncertainty immediately
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The lesson:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Don't assume they understand just because you've explained it
              </li>
              <li>Probe for real understanding and first concrete steps</li>
              <li>
                Most delegation failures happen because this step is skipped
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Don't Take the Monkey ‚Äî Managing Delegation Requests</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              When you're delegating, there's one more thing you need to know:
              the concept of "taking the monkey." This comes from the book "The
              One Minute Manager Meets the Monkey" and it's about what happens
              when people bring problems to you.
            </p>
            <h3>The Monkey Concept</h3>
            <p><strong>How monkeys jump:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Someone comes to you: "Boss, I've got this problem, what do you
                think?"
              </li>
              <li>
                Or: "Boss, I've been talking to this supplier and they're not
                being very helpful"
              </li>
              <li>If you say: "Okay, leave it with me"</li>
              <li>An imaginary monkey jumps from their back onto yours</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The monkey math:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>5 people who work for you</li>
              <li>Each gives you 2 monkeys a day</li>
              <li>You're taking 10 monkeys a day = 50 monkeys a week</li>
              <li>You probably can't deal with that many</li>
              <li>
                You might only handle 20, going "into the red" by 30 monkeys a
                week
              </li>
              <li>After a month: 120 monkeys on your back</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>When you become their employee:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                They start saying: "Boss, did you ever get that supplier sorted
                out for me?"
              </li>
              <li>You say: "Oh no, I still haven't done it, I'm afraid"</li>
              <li>Now you're working for them</li>
              <li>If they're chasing you, you're working for them</li>
              <li>You now have 5 bosses giving you monkeys every day</li>
              <li>Plus your real boss who's also giving you monkeys</li>
              <li>No way you can work for 5+ bosses</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How to Avoid Taking Monkeys</h3>
            <p><strong>Scenario 1: They've tried some things</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                They say: "Boss, I've got this supplier causing me trouble, what
                shall I do?"
              </li>
              <li>DON'T say: "Leave it with me" (monkey poised to jump)</li>
              <li>DO say: "What have you tried so far?"</li>
              <li>They say: "I've tried this, this and this"</li>
              <li>You say: "Why don't you try this?"</li>
              <li>They say: "Okay, yeah, I'll try that"</li>
              <li>
                You say: "Brilliant. When will you be able to let me know how
                you got on?"
              </li>
              <li>They say: "I'll know by tomorrow"</li>
              <li>You say: "Brilliant. Come and see me tomorrow. Bye."</li>
              <li>
                As they leave, you can see the monkey on their back - and it
                feels good
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Scenario 2: They don't know what to do</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                They say: "I don't know what to do. I've tried all the things I
                can think of"
              </li>
              <li>
                Monkey's about to jump, but you say: "How long would it take you
                to come up with a plan? Some suggestions. Maybe go research,
                perhaps talk to Dave - he knows about this."
              </li>
              <li>
                "How long would it take you to come up with some options?"
              </li>
              <li>
                They say: "Probably take me a day to go see Dave and think about
                it"
              </li>
              <li>
                You say: "Okay, come back and see me tomorrow afternoon, and
                we'll look at what options you've got"
              </li>
              <li>Off they go with monkey on their back - feels good</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Scenario 3: They come back with options</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Next day: "So what options have you got?"</li>
              <li>They have several options</li>
              <li>You say: "Which one do you think you should pick?"</li>
              <li>
                Either they pick one: "Brilliant, let me know how you get on in
                a day's time"
              </li>
              <li>Or they say: "I don't know which one to pick"</li>
              <li>
                You say: "How long would it take you to decide which one to
                pick?"
              </li>
              <li>They say: "I need a day to think about it"</li>
              <li>
                You say: "Come back tomorrow and tell me which one you're going
                to pick"
              </li>
              <li>Off they go with monkey - feels good</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The pattern:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The game is to say: "I want you to do it. How long will it
                take?"
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>If they resist:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>They say: "But I want you to do it"</li>
              <li>
                You say: "One of us has got to do it. As the boss, it's my job
                to decide which of us does it. And I've decided it's you."
              </li>
              <li>
                "I'd like you to go away and think about it and come back to me
                with a plan, please."
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Special Situations</h3>
            <p><strong>When you need to make a call for them:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                They say: "I'm having a problem with the marketing department.
                Could you talk to the marketing manager and sort it out?"
              </li>
              <li>
                Monkey poised to jump, but you say: "Okay, just hang on. I'll
                phone him and set up a meeting"
              </li>
              <li>
                You phone marketing manager: "Dave, I've got Fred here and he's
                having problems. Would it be possible for him to come see you
                with my authority? Could you promise you'll help him?"
              </li>
              <li>Marketing guy: "Yeah, no worries. Send him over"</li>
              <li>You to Fred: "He's ready for you. You can go see him now"</li>
              <li>
                While you had that conversation, monkey was poised to jump but
                didn't
              </li>
              <li>
                Fred goes off with monkey still on his back and your authority -
                feels good
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key Insights</h3>
            <p><strong>When you should feel bad:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Very occasionally you may have to take a monkey</li>
              <li>
                But you should have a feeling of failure if you take the monkey
              </li>
              <li>You should think: "Oh, I had to say 'leave it with me'"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Life-changing impact:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                People who've never heard of this say: "I never thought of it
                like that before"
              </li>
              <li>Later they say: "It's really changed their life"</li>
              <li>Make it your aim to not take the monkey</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The control principle:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>You've got control</li>
              <li>You're not going to take that monkey</li>
              <li>
                Keep the monkey where it belongs - with the person who has the
                problem
              </li>

            <h2>Situational Leadership ‚Äî Competence vs. Motivation</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Situational leadership was thought up by Hersey and Blanchard,
              from their book "Leadership and the One Minute Manager." They made
              it more complicated than needed - here's the simple, practical
              version.
            </p>
            <p>Look at each person by two things:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>How competent they are</strong> (Not competent ‚Üí
                Competent)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>How motivated they are</strong> (Not motivated ‚Üí
                Motivated)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The goal: get everyone to the
              <strong>top right</strong> (Competent + Motivated) so you can
              delegate to everybody.

            <p><strong>Top Right (Competent + Motivated):</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>This is where we want everyone</li>
              <li>
                Life would be simple if everyone knew how to do the job AND
                wanted to do it
              </li>
              <li>You could just delegate to everybody</li>
              <li>Your only dilemma: delegate or empower?</li>
              <li>
                Start with delegate; if they keep doing really good work,
                promote them to empower (no monitoring, just trust)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Top Left (Motivated + Not Competent):</strong></p>

              <li><strong>Who:</strong> New people who just arrived</li>
              <li>They want to do the job, they don't know how yet</li>
              <li>
                You can't stay here long-term (either learn and move right, or
                get depressed and drop down)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Style needed:</strong> TELL/TRAIN/TEACH ("This is how
                you do it")
              </li>
              <li>They want clarity, not vague inspiration</li>
              <li>
                Like getting a new computer - just tell them how to switch it on

                <strong>Who:</strong> People who know how but have gone flat
              </li>
              <li>
                Probably bad management: they're bored, neglected, feel passed
                over for promotion
              </li>
              <li>Valuable resource being wasted</li>
              <li>

              <li>Ask for their advice, involve them in decisions</li>

              <li>
                Often management's fault: wrong job, no training, job too
                difficult
              </li>
              <li>
                Doesn't mean they're bad people - they're in wrong place or
                under-coached
              </li>
              <li><strong>Style needed:</strong> COACH ("Information IN")</li>
              <li>Explain, encourage, build small wins, praise progress</li>
              <li>
                Like a tennis coach: make them more competent AND more motivated
              </li>
              <li>
                Use staircase method: learn one thing ‚Üí more competent ‚Üí more

            <h3>Styles for Each Box</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Top Left (New):</strong> TELL - "This is how you do it"
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Top Right (Ready):</strong> DELEGATE (monitor + support)

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bottom Right (Flat):</strong> INVOLVE - ask advice, pull
                expertise, thank
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bottom Left (Struggling):</strong> COACH - explain,
                encourage, staircase up
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Praise vs. Thank:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Left side (developing): PRAISE effort and learning</li>
              <li>Right side (competent): THANK for contribution and advice</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Moving People to Top Right</h3>
            <p>
              From all other boxes, we're trying to move people to top right:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Top Left ‚Üí Top Right:</strong> Teach until competent,
                slide across
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bottom Left ‚Üí Top Right:</strong> Coach in steps
                (competence ‚Üë drives motivation ‚Üë)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bottom Right ‚Üí Top Right:</strong> Involve, consult,
                appreciate ‚Üí motivation rises
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Avoid:</strong> Top Left plunging to Bottom Left (give
                enough training early)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key Points</h3>
            <p><strong>About empowerment:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Empowerment wasn't in their original theory, but fits in top
                right
              </li>
              <li>
                Only use after someone proves themselves through repeated good
                delegation results
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>About the boxes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You can't sustain being motivated but not competent forever
              </li>
              <li>New people need TELL, not vague selling of the future</li>
              <li>Competent + unmotivated usually means management neglect</li>
              <li>
                "Everything's management's fault" - selection, training, support
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The coaching staircase:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Person learns one thing ‚Üí becomes more competent ‚Üí motivation ‚Üë
                ‚Üí "What else can I learn?"
              </li>
              <li>
                Teach next bit ‚Üí motivation ‚Üë ‚Üí competence ‚Üë ‚Üí staircase up to
                top right
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>One-line summary:</strong>
              Judge your style by their competence + motivation: Tell (new),
              Coach (neither), Involve (competent but flat), Delegate ‚Üí Empower
              (both high).

            <h2>Dave's Story ‚Äî When Situational Leadership Goes Wrong</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              This story illustrates what happens when you use the wrong
              leadership style for a situation. It's not about the person being
              in one box ‚Äî it's about each specific situation requiring a
              different approach.
            </p>
            <h3>The Setup</h3>
            <p><strong>Dave's strengths:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Very good technically (competent + motivated = top right)</li>
              <li>
                Very good 1-to-1 with people (competent + motivated = top right)
              </li>
              <li>A "user-friendly techie" ‚Äî valuable combination</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The boss's logic:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>"This project needs technical skills and people skills"</li>
              <li>
                "Dave has both ‚Äî he'll be perfect for running this project"
              </li>
              <li>"I'll put Dave in charge"</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>First Project Disaster</h3>
            <p><strong>What the boss did:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                "Right Dave, you're in charge of the project. Good luck. See you
                in six months."
              </li>
              <li>
                Called it "delegating" but really was
                <strong>abdicating</strong> (no monitoring, no support
                available)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The situational analysis:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Technical work:</strong> Dave = top right (competent +
                motivated)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>People work:</strong> Dave = top right (competent +
                motivated)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Project management:</strong> Dave =
                <strong>bottom left</strong> (not competent + not motivated)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why bottom left?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Not competent:</strong> Never done project management,
                doesn't know how
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Not motivated:</strong> Doesn't want to manage his
                friends, taken off coding work he loves
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Wrong style used:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Boss gave <strong>delegating style</strong> because Dave was top
                right for everything else
              </li>
              <li>
                Should have used <strong>coaching style</strong> for project
                management specifically
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What should have happened:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                "Dave, you haven't done project management before, but don't
                worry ‚Äî I'm going to work with you"
              </li>
              <li>
                "I'm going to teach you how to do it and add this to your
                skills"
              </li>
              <li>"Tell me, what would you do first?"</li>
              <li>Dave: "Probably just start writing code"</li>
              <li>Boss: "No, why not do a Gantt chart first?"</li>
              <li>Dave: "What's one of those?"</li>
              <li>
                Then teach, coach, gradually build competence and motivation
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The result:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>¬£100,000 over budget</li>
              <li>Total disaster</li>
              <li>Dave got massively reprimanded for "incompetence"</li>
              <li>
                But everything is management's fault ‚Äî wrong style was used
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Second Project Disaster</h3>
            <p><strong>Six months later:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Another project needed a leader</li>
              <li>Only person available was Dave again</li>
              <li>Boss thought: "Hopefully Dave learned from last time"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The money motivation attempt:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                "Dave, instead of ¬£30K, if it goes well and comes in on time and
                budget, I'll give you ¬£40K"
              </li>
              <li>
                "If it goes wrong and comes in late, I'll only give you ¬£20K"
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What happened:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Saved ¬£10K on wage bill</li>
              <li>But another project went ¬£100K over budget</li>
              <li>
                Dave was just terrified ‚Äî still had "smell of failure" from last
                time
              </li>
              <li>
                "Oh no, it's going to go wrong. I hate project management."
              </li>
              <li>Money didn't help ‚Äî it just frightened him</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Even if the money had worked:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Dave would have become motivated but still not competent</li>
              <li>
                Would have moved to <strong>top left</strong> (motivated + not
                competent)
              </li>
              <li>
                Boss should have said: "I'm going to motivate you with money AND
                tell you how to get the ¬£40K"
              </li>
              <li>
                "Here's exactly what you have to do" (Tell style for top left)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>But that didn't happen:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Motivation didn't work</li>
              <li>Boss still just left him in delegate mode</li>
              <li>Totally unsuitable for someone in bottom left box</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The final result:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Another ¬£100K over budget</li>
              <li>Dave reprimanded a second time</li>
              <li>Dave now hates project management</li>
              <li>Dave left the company</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key Lessons</h3>
            <p><strong>It's not about the person:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Dave wasn't "a bottom left person"</li>
              <li>
                Dave was brilliant (top right) for technical and people work
              </li>
              <li>
                Dave was bottom left specifically for project management
                situation
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Situational leadership means:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>A situation is in one of the boxes, not the person</li>
              <li>
                You might be in all four boxes for different parts of your job
              </li>
              <li>
                Your boss needs to select the correct style for each situation
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The boss's napkin moment:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When shown the four boxes on a napkin: "Oh, of course I can see
                it now"
              </li>
              <li>Situational leadership is simple once you see the theory</li>
              <li>But devastating when you get it wrong</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The pattern of repeated failure:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If someone lets you down twice, ask: "Why didn't I learn after
                the first time?"
              </li>
              <li>
                Usually it's the wrong leadership style being applied
                consistently
              </li>
              <li>
                "Everything's management's fault" ‚Äî selection, training, and
                style choice
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Application</h3>
            <p><strong>Before assigning any task, ask:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>For this specific situation, are they competent?</li>
              <li>For this specific situation, are they motivated?</li>
              <li>What style does that combination require?</li>
              <li>
                Don't assume someone who's top right in one area is top right
                everywhere
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Remember:</strong> We are all in different boxes for
              different situations. The key is matching your leadership style to
              each specific situation, not to the person overall.

            <h2>The Freedom Ladder ‚Äî Progressive Autonomy</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              The Freedom Ladder is another leadership style theory that focuses
              on gradually increasing people's autonomy and decision-making
              freedom. It shows how to systematically move people from passive
              obedience to active ownership, benefiting both motivation and time
              efficiency.
            </p>
            <h3>The Five Levels</h3>
            <p>

                alt="The Freedom Ladder ‚Äî five levels of progressive autonomy"
              />
            </p>
            <p><strong>Level 1: Wait Until Told</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                They turn up to work and just sit there until you give them a
                job
              </li>
              <li>
                When they finish, they sit there again until you give them
                another job
              </li>
              <li>"I suppose they're all right ‚Äî at least they're obedient"</li>
              <li>
                (There's arguably a level below this: "Don't Do What You're
                Told," but hopefully nobody's there)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Level 2: Ask What Next?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>"I've done that. What shall I do now?"</li>
              <li>Shows some initiative and motivation</li>
              <li>
                Move them up by helping them understand the mission: "What are
                we trying to do here?"
              </li>
              <li>Then they can start saying: "How can I help?"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Level 3: Suggest (Check Before Acting)</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                They come with ideas: "I've noticed the cupboard needs sorting.
                Would you like me to do that?"
              </li>
              <li>"We've got mistakes on the database. Shall I tidy it up?"</li>
              <li>
                "I think we need to work overtime this weekend. Is that okay?"
              </li>
              <li>
                "I need to get repair guys in at the weekend. Can I do that?"
              </li>
              <li>Great ‚Äî they're motivated enough to suggest ideas</li>
              <li>Still quite controlled ‚Äî they must check before acting</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Level 4: Act Then Report</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>"By the way, we came in and fixed some things"</li>
              <li>"I've sorted out the database for you"</li>
              <li>They must be competent and trustworthy for this level</li>
              <li>
                Not too risky ‚Äî they can only go wrong by one weekend/one job
              </li>
              <li>
                You can say: "Next time leave that till Monday ‚Äî it didn't have
                to be done at the weekend"
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Level 5: Free to Act</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                They don't have to tell you every time ‚Äî they just get on with
                it
              </li>
              <li>Best for them: job satisfaction</li>
              <li>Best for you: most time effective</li>
              <li>But involves letting go of control</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Moving People Up</h3>
            <p><strong>The control challenge:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Some bosses like to keep people at the bottom: "Don't do
                anything without me telling you first"
              </li>
              <li>
                But in the first three levels, you still have plenty of control
              </li>
              <li>
                Even at Level 3 (Suggest), you can still say: "No, I don't want
                you to do that"
              </li>
              <li>At least move them to Level 3, ideally to Level 5</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>People who want to stay at the bottom:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                "I don't really understand why someone would want to be like
                that"
              </li>
              <li>
                "I think they must be damaged if they just sit there going
                'Well, you tell me what you want'"
              </li>
              <li>Anyone who's any good won't want to just sit there</li>
              <li>
                "It's safe and they get an easy life, but surely if they care
                about their work, they ought to want to be higher up"
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The dream:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Everyone at the top ‚Äî boss trusts you to get on with it, and you
                just get on with it
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Moving People Up Task by Task</h3>
            <p><strong>Like situational leadership:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>It's not the whole person who moves up</li>
              <li>It's every part of the job, all the things they do</li>
              <li>Each task can be moved up one level</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Working weekends decision: Move from "Suggest" to "Report
                Afterwards"
              </li>
              <li>
                Other things: Move from "Report Afterwards" to "Free to Act"
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Questions to ask:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Where are the people who work for you?</li>
              <li>Can you move them higher up the ladder?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Moving Yourself Up</h3>
            <p><strong>Focus on time savings:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                "Rather than come to you before the weekend every time with a
                big list, why don't I just do it? I'll give you a list on Monday
                morning. It'll save you time and hassle."
              </li>
              <li>
                "Instead of bringing you a list every Monday, why don't I just
                send you a monthly report?"
              </li>
              <li>
                "Why don't you just give me a budget and I'll make sure I don't
                overspend? Then you don't have to worry about it. I'll just sort
                it for you."
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The sales pitch:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>You can sell it to the boss because it saves them time.</li>
              <li>It also gives you more freedom.</li>
              <li>Win‚Äëwin situation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Connection to Other Theories</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>Wait Until Told = Tell style</li>
              <li>Ask What Next = Sell style (with explanation of mission)</li>

            <h2>Grip in Delegation ‚Äî How Much Control to Keep</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              When you delegate anything, you need to decide
              <strong>how much grip you need to keep</strong>. The concept of
              "grip" refers to your level of monitoring and control over
              delegated work. You can choose from very loose to very tight grip
              depending on the situation, person, and importance of the task.
            </p>
            <h3>The grip spectrum</h3>
            <p><strong>Loosest grip ‚Äî Empowerment:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>"Go for it. If there's a problem, come and see me."</li>
              <li>Complete autonomy with support available on request.</li>
              <li>
                Management by exception ‚Äî they only come if there's a problem.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Periodic reporting:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>"When you've done the next part, come and let me know."</li>
              <li>Monthly check‚Äëins: "Come and see me once a month."</li>
              <li>Weekly updates: "Come and see me once a week."</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Daily monitoring:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>"Come and see me every morning and give me an update."</li>
              <li>Still delegation ‚Äî they do it however they like.</li>
              <li>But tight grip because it's difficult or important.</li>
              <li>
                "You're doing it, you can do it however you like, but I want
                daily updates."
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tightest grip ‚Äî Full oversight:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Review everything before it happens.</li>
              <li>Constant supervision while maintaining delegation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Monitoring strategies</h3>
            <p><strong>Weekly team meetings:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Smart way to keep grip without micromanaging.</li>
              <li>
                Each person reports on their projects as you go round the room.
              </li>
              <li>
                "Dave, how are you getting on with that job? Fred, how are you
                getting on with that job?"
              </li>
              <li>Allows you to keep grip on everything once a week.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Visual tracking:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Charts on the wall showing key metrics.</li>
              <li>
                Number of sales visits, amount of scrap, progress indicators.
              </li>
              <li>You can check whenever you want ‚Äî daily or monthly.</li>
              <li>Modern version: online dashboards, cloud‚Äëbased tracking.</li>
              <li>
                "The chart doesn't have to be on the wall ‚Äî it could be online
                so you can look whenever you want."
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Drilling down techniques</h3>
            <p>
              For underperforming people who need really tight grip, use these
              "drilling down" methods:
            </p>
            <p><strong>Master list review:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                "Can I see your master list of all the jobs you've got on?"
              </li>
              <li>
                If they don't have one: "How long will it take? A day? Come back
                tomorrow with your master list."
              </li>
              <li>Once you see the list, check they're doing what you want.</li>
              <li>Get it in priority order: "Put them in order for me."</li>
              <li>
                You can adjust priorities: "I want that one sooner and that one
                can wait."
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Daily list inspection:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Tightest grip of all.</li>
              <li>During MBWA: "Hi Fred, what have you got on today?"</li>
              <li>Look at their daily plan.</li>
              <li>
                Challenge priorities: "Why are you doing that? Is that one
                urgent?"
              </li>
              <li>
                Add missing items: "I don't see X on there ‚Äî I want that."

                I'm doing a bit of monitoring."
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>When to tighten or loosen grip</h3>
            <p><strong>Tighten grip when:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Person is underperforming or unreliable.</li>
              <li>Task is critical or high‚Äërisk.</li>
              <li>Someone is new to this type of work.</li>
              <li>Previous attempts have gone wrong.</li>
              <li>You notice their daily list is "all over the place".</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Loosen grip when:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Person has proven competence.</li>
              <li>Trust has been built over time.</li>
              <li>Task is routine or low‚Äërisk.</li>
              <li>You want to develop their autonomy.</li>
              <li>They've earned it through good performance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Adjust by moving on the continuum:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If daily lists show confusion, maybe move from delegating to
                consulting.
              </li>
              <li>
                On the Freedom Ladder, maybe move from "Act Then Report" back to
                "Suggest".
              </li>
              <li>
                "Maybe I need to get him to check with me before he does
                anything because he doesn't seem to have an idea of what he's
                meant to be doing."
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The key principle:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You decide your grip strategy based on person + task + risk.
              </li>
              <li>Start with appropriate grip level.</li>
              <li>Adjust based on performance.</li>
              <li>
                Always explain your monitoring level so they understand the
                rules.

            <h2>Planning vs. Doing ‚Äî Two-Dimensional Leadership Control</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              At first glance, Tannenbaum &amp; Schmidt's leadership continuum
              (Tell, Sell, Consult, Share, Delegate) and the Freedom Ladder seem
              very similar. Both progress from tight control to autonomy. But
              there's a crucial insight:
              <strong>one applies to planning, the other to doing</strong>.
              Understanding this creates a powerful two-dimensional framework
              for leadership decisions.
            </p>
            <h3>The key insight</h3>
            <p><strong>Initial observation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Person at bottom of Freedom Ladder ("Wait Until Told") matches
                "Tell" style
              </li>
              <li>
                Person at top of Freedom Ladder ("Free to Act") matches
                "Delegate/Empower" style
              </li>
              <li>
                Only the ends are similar ‚Äî the middle sections are different
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The deeper realization:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Tannenbaum &amp; Schmidt = Planning decisions</strong>:
                How much input do they get in deciding HOW to approach the work?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Freedom Ladder = Doing decisions</strong>: How much
                autonomy do they have WHILE executing the work?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Planning axis (Tannenbaum &amp; Schmidt)</h3>
            <p>When planning how to do a new job, you decide:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Tell</strong>: "Do it this specific way" (zero input)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Sell</strong>: "Do it this way, here's why" (explained
                but not negotiable)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Consult</strong>: "I'm thinking this approach, what do
                you think?" (input welcome)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Share</strong>: "Let's figure out the approach together"
                (joint planning)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Delegate</strong>: "Achieve this outcome however you
                think best" (full planning autonomy)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Doing axis (Freedom Ladder)</h3>
            <p>When they're executing the work, you decide:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Wait Until Told</strong>: Check before every action
              </li>
              <li><strong>Ask What Next</strong>: Check after each step</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Suggest</strong>: Propose approach, get approval, then
                proceed
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Act Then Report</strong>: Take action, then inform
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Free to Act</strong>: Complete autonomy during execution
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The four quadrants</h3>
            <p><strong>Top Left ‚Äî Tight Planning + Loose Doing:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>"I'll tell you exactly how to approach this..."</li>
              <li>
                "...but once you start, just get on with it and hardly report at
                all."
              </li>
              <li>
                Logic: Clear method reduces risk; execution freedom maintains
                motivation.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Top Right ‚Äî Loose Planning + Loose Doing:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>"Plan it however you want..."</li>
              <li>"...and execute with full autonomy."</li>
              <li>
                Ultimate empowerment: total trust in both planning and
                execution.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Bottom Left ‚Äî Tight Planning + Tight Doing:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>"I'll tell you how to do it..."</li>
              <li>"...and you must check with me at every step."</li>
              <li>
                High control but "quite time consuming for you and not much fun
                for them."
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Bottom Right ‚Äî Loose Planning + Tight Doing:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                "Delegate the planning ‚Äî they can plan however they want..."
              </li>
              <li>
                "...but when they do it, they have to tell you about every
                step."
              </li>
              <li>
                Logic: Leverage their expertise for planning; maintain control
                during execution.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Strategic movement toward empowerment</h3>
            <p><strong>The progression goal:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Look at each person and think: "Can I move them a bit further to
                the right and can I move them a bit down on this chart?"
              </li>
              <li>Keep trying to empower them more and more</li>
              <li>
                Ultimate target: bottom right (loose planning + loose doing)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Practical recommendations:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                "I would urge you at least to give them some freedom either on
                the planning (bottom left) or on the doing (top right)"
              </li>
              <li>Avoid top left (tight on both) whenever possible</li>
              <li>
                Choose your battles: tight control on one dimension, freedom on
                the other
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>For any job, ask yourself:</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Planning freedom</strong>: How much input should they
                have in HOW we approach this?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Execution freedom</strong>: How much autonomy should
                they have WHILE doing this?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Movement strategy</strong>: How can I increase freedom
                on one or both dimensions over time?
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Examples in practice</h3>
            <p><strong>New project with experienced person:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Planning: Consult or Delegate (leverage their experience)</li>
              <li>
                Doing: Act Then Report or Free to Act (trust their execution)
              </li>
              <li>Result: Bottom right quadrant</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Critical task with junior person:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Planning: Tell or Sell (provide clear direction)</li>
              <li>
                Doing: Suggest or Act Then Report (allow some execution
                autonomy)
              </li>
              <li>Result: Top left quadrant with plan to move right</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Complex strategy with mixed team:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Planning: Share (get all perspectives)</li>
              <li>Doing: Ask What Next (ensure alignment during execution)</li>

              Leadership Schedule ‚Äî Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly Checklist
            </h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              After covering all the leadership theories and frameworks, here's
              a practical synthesis:
              <strong
                >What should a boss actually do every day, every week, every
                month, and every year?</strong

              This checklist brings together all the key concepts into a
              manageable routine that ensures you're hitting the most important
              leadership activities consistently.
            </p>
            <h3>Daily essentials (3 items)</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>1. Management by Walking Around (MBWA) ‚Äî 1 hour</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Spend about an hour daily just checking everyone's happy</li>
              <li>Be physically present, talk with staff</li>
              <li>Ratio: 25% speaking, 75% listening</li>
              <li>Verify information cascade reaches the frontline</li>
              <li>This is really important for staying connected</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. Thinking Time ‚Äî 30 minutes</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Half an hour of dedicated thinking every day</li>
              <li>Getting ahead of the game time</li>
              <li>Could be investigating a problem or strategic planning</li>
              <li>
                Think about: vision, improving systems, how are people doing?
              </li>
              <li>Essential for working ON the business, not just IN it</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>3. End-of-Day Organisation ‚Äî Job List Review</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Time management thing ‚Äî every boss has to be organised.</li>
              <li>
                You can't organise other people unless you organise yourself.
              </li>
              <li>Review and plan your job list at the end of every day</li>
              <li>Set yourself up for tomorrow</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Daily summary:</strong> "That's the only things you got to
              do every day" ‚Äî just three focused activities that keep you
              connected, strategic, and organised.
            </p>
            <h3>Weekly priorities (4 items)</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Thank Everyone ‚Äî Individual Recognition</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Thank everyone who works for you approximately weekly</li>
              <li>One-to-one thanks for something definite they've done</li>
              <li>
                Must be specific and real ‚Äî not just "thanks for being great"
              </li>
              <li>

              <li>
                "If there's anything on there you're not doing, maybe you could
                start doing that today"
              </li>
              <li>Pick one area where you're weakest and focus there first</li>
              <li>
                Build the habits gradually ‚Äî don't try to do everything at once
              </li>

              <li>Consistency beats perfection</li>
              <li>These activities compound over time</li>

              Three Types of Leadership Theory ‚Äî Traits, Transactional,
              Transformational
            </h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              There are three broad approaches often cited in leadership theory.
              The transcript challenges the usefulness of ‚Äútraits,‚Äù endorses
              ‚Äútransactional‚Äù (action-based, teachable behaviors), and questions
              whether ‚Äútransformational‚Äù is anything more than a rebranding of
              good transactional practice.
            </p>
            <h3>The three models</h3>
            <p>1. Trait theory (personality-based)</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Premise: Great leaders share inherent traits (e.g.,
                intelligence, charisma, decisiveness, listening).
              </li>
              <li>
                Problems:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Contradictions and variance: Genghis Khan vs. Gandhi share
                    few consistent traits; many styles can succeed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Untrainable implication: If leadership rests on fixed
                    traits, how do people acquire them? Discouraging and
                    impractical.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Conclusion: Largely futile for development; poor guide for
                    action.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>2. Transactional leadership (behavior- and systems-based)</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Premise: Leadership is what you do, not who you are.</li>
              <li>
                Adair‚Äôs lens: Balance Task, Team, and Individual; run the cycle
                of Set Objectives ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Brief ‚Üí Execute/Monitor/Control ‚Üí
                Review.
              </li>
              <li>
                Options for ‚Äúhow‚Äù to transact: Tell, Sell, Consult, Share,
                Delegate, Empower; cadence and control depend on risk,
                capability, and context.
              </li>
              <li>
                Examples: Weekly team meetings, MBWA, clear objectives,
                planning, reviews ‚Äî all concrete, teachable transactions.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>3. Transformational leadership (inspiration-based)</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Premise: Leaders ‚Äútransform‚Äù followers and culture by inspiring
                them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Critique in transcript: Much of what‚Äôs called transformational
                (vision, walking around, listening, eating last) are simply
                transactional behaviors. Risk of ‚ÄúEmperor‚Äôs new clothes‚Äù if it
                adds labels without new actionable practices.
              </li>
              <li>
                Nuance: Inspiration is valuable, but it manifests through
                concrete transactions (communication, structure, recognition,
                involvement).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Practical takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Build leadership on actions you can teach and measure:
                objectives, planning, briefing, cadence of monitoring, reviews,
                and continuous communication.
              </li>
              <li>
                Choose control style situationally (Tannenbaum &amp; Schmidt;
                Freedom Ladder; Situational Leadership) ‚Äî start safe, then earn
                the right to loosen grip.
              </li>
              <li>
                Treat ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù as the effect of many good transactions, not
                a substitute for them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Avoid trait-shopping; focus on developing repeatable behaviors
                and systems.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Q&A</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Are traits useless? Not entirely ‚Äî self-awareness helps ‚Äî but
                traits are unreliable as a development roadmap; behaviors win.
              </li>
              <li>
                What actually changes a team? Consistent transactions: clear
                goals, involvement, recognition, support, and fair systems.
              </li>
              <li>
                Is transformational real? It can describe outcomes (energized,
                self-driven teams), but the levers are transactional.
              </li>
              <li>
                Where to start this week? Add/upgrade one ritual: weekly team
                meeting, MBWA hour, or a tighter brief‚Äìmonitor‚Äìreview loop on a
                key project.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>One-line summary</h3>
            <p>
              Lead with teachable behaviors (transactions); let ‚Äútransformation‚Äù
              be the outcome, not the method.

            <h2>The Do‚ÄìGet‚ÄìFeel Loop ‚Äî Breaking Negative Cycles</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Why do some people love a job while others hate the same job with
              the same boss? Often the difference isn‚Äôt the role but the cycle
              they‚Äôre in. Past management can damage attitudes, leaving people
              defensive and disengaged. Leaders can deliberately flip that cycle
              from red (negative) to green (positive).
            </p>
            <h3>The loop (Do ‚Üí Get ‚Üí Feel ‚Üí Do)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Do: How someone behaves at work (effort, quality, attitude).
              </li>
              <li>
                Get: The reaction they receive (thanks, opportunities, support ‚Äî
                or criticism, sanctions).
              </li>
              <li>
                Feel: How that reaction lands (pride, belonging, motivation ‚Äî or
                resentment, fear, apathy).
              </li>
              <li>
                Back to Do: Feelings drive the next behavior ‚Äî reinforcing a
                positive or negative loop.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Positive loop: Do good work ‚Üí Get recognition/ownership ‚Üí Feel

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Break Feel ‚Üí Do: Even if you feel flat, choose to do your
                    best work anyway.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Improve Do ‚Üí Get: Try to influence your boss with

                  <li>
                    Change what they Get: When performance dips, respond with
                    ‚Äúgreen‚Äù (supportive, developmental) rather than ‚Äúred‚Äù
                    (punitive, cynical).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Offer a clean second attempt: ‚ÄúI think you can do better ‚Äî
                    let‚Äôs try again and I‚Äôll help.‚Äù
                  </li>

                </ul>

            </ul>
            <h3>Leader playbook (green responses)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Default to specific recognition for effort and progress;
                separate appreciation from correction.
              </li>
              <li>
                When annoyed, pause ‚Äî choose understanding and coaching over

              </li>
              <li>
                Set clear objectives, limits, and support paths; agree

              </li>
              <li>
                Re-contract after errors: clarify ‚Äúwhat good looks like,‚Äù
                provide help, and schedule a quick re-run to rebuild confidence.
              </li>
              <li>
                Avoid seagull management: don‚Äôt fly in, criticize, and fly out.

              <li>
                Create a visible ‚Äúthanks‚Äù cadence (weekly) to keep the green

              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Q&A</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Can people fix the loop by themselves? Sometimes, but it‚Äôs hard;
                leaders should own the environment that makes green cycles
                likely.
              </li>
              <li>
                Won‚Äôt green responses enable slackers? Pair warmth with clarity
                and follow-up. Support first; escalate only after fair coaching
                and clear expectations.
              </li>
              <li>
                How fast can a loop flip? Often weeks of consistent green
                responses and small wins; speed up with quick, well-scoped
                retries.
              </li>
              <li>
                What if history made them cynical? Consistency is the cure:
                predictable fairness, real listening, and tangible
                opportunities.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>One-line summary</h3>

              Flip red cycles to green by changing what people Get and modeling

            <h2>Maslow √ó Personality ‚Äî Motivators by Type</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Maslow says we all share the same needs (physiological, security,
              social/belonging, esteem/status, self‚Äëactualization). The twist
              here: personality skews which needs people prioritize. Use the
              four‚Äëtypes lens (Analytical, Controller, Enthusiast, Amiable) to
              tune how you motivate.
            </p>
            <h3>The mapping</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Amiable (quiet + people‚Äëled): strongest pull to Social/Belonging
                and Security; less interested in Status.
              </li>
              <li>
                Enthusiast (outgoing + people‚Äëled): Social + Status; lower
                Security need than Amiable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Controller (outgoing + logical): Self‚Äëactualization via impact;
                also needs Status/authority to act.
              </li>
              <li>
                Analytical (quiet + logical): Self‚Äëactualization via mastery +
                Security (clear rules/structures); low Social/Status pull.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Note: Physiological needs are universal; we focus on the upper
              four where preferences diverge.
            </p>
            <h3>Motivator focus by type</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Amiable
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Motivate with: belonging, care, stability, team rituals,
                    trusted relationships.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    De‚Äëemphasize: flashy titles/status; avoid abrupt change
                    without context/safety.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Enthusiast
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Motivate with: social energy, visible recognition, spotlight
                    moments, creative variety.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    De‚Äëemphasize: heavy bureaucracy; keep guardrails light but
                    clear.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Controller
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Motivate with: autonomy + scope, hard challenges, clear
                    decision rights, measurable impact.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    De‚Äëemphasize: micromanagement; provide status signals only
                    to enable action, not as end goals.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

                Analytical
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Motivate with: interesting problems, depth, data/clarity,
                    defined ownership, stable systems.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    De‚Äëemphasize: noisy social/showmanship; give quiet
                    recognition tied to craft and correctness.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Leadership actions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Calibrate Security: transparent rules and consistent behaviour
                reduce anxiety for Amiable/Analytical; Controllers/Enthusiasts
                accept more risk.
              </li>
              <li>
                Shape recognition: public and lively for Enthusiasts; precise
                and private is often better for Analyticals; esteem via
                responsibility for Controllers; appreciation for
                helpfulness/team glue for Amiables.
              </li>
              <li>
                Design roles/objectives: give Controllers authority to act; give
                Analyticals deep ownership zones; give Enthusiasts visible,
                creative work with deadlines; give Amiables customer/team‚Äëcare
                responsibilities.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tune comms: 1:1 and written clarity for Analyticals; energetic
                group forums for Enthusiasts; crisp checkpoints for Controllers;
                reassuring updates for Amiables.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Q&A</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Do people fit only one box? No ‚Äî this is a heuristic. People
                blend; stress can shift preferences. Use it to start the
                conversation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Can motivators change? Yes ‚Äî context and career stage matter.
                Re‚Äëcheck preferences periodically.
              </li>
              <li>
                How does this relate to Maslow‚Äôs order? Security still underpins
                the rest for most people; personality changes intensity, not the
                overall logic.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>One-line summary</h3>
            <p>
              Everyone shares the same needs ‚Äî personality tells you which
              levers to pull hardest for each person.

            <h2>Ownership ‚Äî Every Task Needs One Owner</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Ownership multiplies motivation and reliability: every task should
              have a single, named owner ‚Äî and every person should own
              something. Shared or ownerless work quietly decays.
            </p>
            <h3>Why single ownership</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Clarity: one accountable person drives action and decisions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Speed: fewer hand‚Äëoffs, fewer ‚ÄúI thought they were doing it‚Äù
                delays.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pride: even tiny domains create esteem and care (‚Äúthis is
                mine‚Äù).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Anti-patterns</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Co‚Äëowned tasks: two owners = no owner; disagreement and
                diffusion of responsibility.
              </li>
              <li>
                Orphan tasks: nobody owns it ‚Üí it doesn‚Äôt get done (or only in
                crises).
              </li>
              <li>
                Ownerless people: someone with no owned area tends to disengage.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Leader actions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Map the work: list key recurring tasks/projects in your area;
                assign exactly one owner for each. A person may own multiple
                tasks; a task must have one owner.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fill the gaps: find orphan tasks and ownerless people; assign
                meaningful, sized‚Äëright ownership (start small if needed).
              </li>
              <li>
                Make ownership visible: simple RACI/owner list on a page; review
                in weekly team meetings.
              </li>
              <li>
                Define ‚Äúdone‚Äù and limits: clarify success criteria, time/budget
                constraints, and check‚Äëin cadence.
              </li>
              <li>
                Grow ownership: as people succeed, expand scope; rotate
                ownership to develop breadth.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Quick checklist</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Does every important task have exactly one named owner?</li>
              <li>
                Does every person own at least one thing they can point to with
                pride?
              </li>
              <li>Can each owner state success criteria and next check‚Äëin?</li>
              <li>Are any tasks silently co‚Äëowned or drifting? Fix today.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>One-line summary</h3>
            <p>
              Assign exactly one owner per task ‚Äî and at least one task per
              person ‚Äî to unlock clarity, pride, and dependable execution.

            <h2>The Banana of Boredom ‚Äî Extending Situational Leadership</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Situational Leadership says match your style to each person‚Äôs
              competence and motivation. But there‚Äôs a hidden trap after someone
              becomes competent: boredom. Skills rise, tasks stay the same,
              energy dips ‚Äî performance curves like a ‚Äúbanana.‚Äù Without fresh
              challenge, people slide from motivated to flat, then resistant.
              You can prevent the banana by planning new stretches at the right
              time.
            </p>
            <h3>The two paths (U-bend vs. Banana)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                U-bend (healthy cycle): New ‚Üí learning ‚Üí competent ‚Üí motivated ‚Üí
                new stretch ‚Üí back into learning. Motivation stays high because
                the next challenge arrives just before boredom.
              </li>
              <li>
                Banana (unhealthy curve): New ‚Üí learning ‚Üí competent ‚Üí same work
                forever ‚Üí interest fades ‚Üí motivation drops ‚Üí performance
                declines. Leader misreads the drop as attitude, not staleness.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              What to watch for: faster completion with less sparkle; fewer
              ideas volunteered; rising nitpicks; ‚Äúsame old‚Äù comments; more
              social scrolling; mild cynicism. These are early banana signals,
              not character flaws.
            </p>
            <h3>The mini-banana (keep stars fresh)</h3>
            <p>
              High performers are most at risk ‚Äî they stabilise earliest.
              Prevent micro‚Äëstagnation by inserting small novelty loops:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Rotate outcomes: same domain, different metric (quality ‚Üí
                throughput ‚Üí customer NPS ‚Üí cost).
              </li>
              <li>
                Change constraints: tighter budget, shorter cycle, new tool, new
                partner.
              </li>
              <li>
                Expand scope: upstream/downstream ownership; adjacent skill
                (teach, mentor, define standards).
              </li>
              <li>
                Visibility burst: demo to execs/customers; write an internal
                guide; lead a brown-bag.
              </li>
              <li>
                10‚Äì20% time: a personal improvement project that benefits the
                team.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Aim: reset them briefly to ‚Äúlearning mode‚Äù without yanking away
              autonomy or flooding risk.
            </p>
            <h3>Leader actions (anti-banana playbook)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Forecast boredom: during appraisals and monthlies, ask ‚ÄúWhat
                will feel too easy in 60‚Äì90 days?‚Äù
              </li>
              <li>
                Pre-commit a stretch: document ‚Äúnow ‚Üí next ‚Üí later‚Äù so the next
                hill appears before the plateau.
              </li>
              <li>
                Shift style deliberately: as competence peaks, move planning
                freedom right (consult/share/delegate) while adding a fresh
                challenge; maintain recognition cadence (Potato theory).
              </li>
              <li>
                Use the two-axis control model: give freedom on either planning
                or doing (ideally both) while varying goals/constraints to keep
                it interesting.
              </li>
              <li>
                Mix challenge with safety: pair stretch with clear limits,
                checkpoints, and available support.
              </li>
              <li>
                Rotate ownership: trade domains between strong peers once or
                twice a year to refresh learning.
              </li>
              <li>
                Watch load vs. novelty: don‚Äôt confuse overwhelm with growth; add
                challenge by swapping, not just stacking.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Q&A</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Isn‚Äôt boredom their problem? Partly ‚Äî but designing work and
                development is management‚Äôs job. Preventable boredom is a
                leadership miss.
              </li>
              <li>
                What if we can‚Äôt promote? Growth isn‚Äôt only promotion: widen
                scope, deepen craft, teach others, own a KPI, run an experiment.
              </li>
              <li>
                How to avoid churn for steady types? Keep the core routine but
                add a small, meaningful improvement stream; recognize
                craftsmanship publicly and privately.
              </li>
              <li>
                How does this link to Maslow and Personality? Stagnation hits
                esteem/self‚Äëactualization needs; Controllers crave bigger hills,
                Analyticals crave deeper mastery, Enthusiasts crave
                variety/visibility, Amiables value purpose and team impact ‚Äî
                tailor the stretch accordingly.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>One-line summary</h3>
            <p>
              Plan the next stretch before competence turns into boredom ‚Äî keep
              people in learning mode to stop motivation curving into a banana.

            <h2>Tell ‚Üí Delegate ‚Äî The Christmas Tree of Competence</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Tannenbaum &amp; Schmidt shows a left‚Üíright scale of control
              (Tell, Sell, Consult, Share, Delegate, Empower). Situational
              Leadership maps competence and motivation. This section adds a
              simple bridge between ‚ÄúTell‚Äù and ‚ÄúDelegate‚Äù: reduce how much you
              prescribe the HOW each time you give a similar job. That tapering
              looks like a Christmas tree: lots of ‚Äúhow‚Äù at the start, then less
              and less as competence proves itself.
            </p>
            <h3>Tell vs. Delegate (what vs. how)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Tell = say WHAT you want and HOW to do it.</li>
              <li>Delegate = say WHAT you want and let them decide HOW.</li>
              <li>
                Bad delegating = say only a vague WHAT without limits/support
                (‚ÄúSell more to Scotland‚Äù) and no clarity on budget, cadence, or
                decision rights.
              </li>
              <li>
                Good delegating = clear WHAT, context, constraints, and
                check-ins ‚Äî but no HOW.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Sliding scale of ‚Äúhow much how‚Äù</h3>
            <p>
              You don‚Äôt need to march through every middle style mechanically.
              For recurring, similar missions, simply reduce the HOW you provide
              over time:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                First time (near Tell): WHAT + lots of HOW ‚Äî safe scaffolding
                while they learn.
              </li>
              <li>
                Next time: WHAT + a few key HOW constraints (‚Äúlike last time,
                but watch X‚Äù).
              </li>
              <li>
                Later: WHAT only + boundaries (budget/time/risk) + cadence ‚Äî
                they own the HOW.
              </li>
              <li>
                Eventually: Empower ‚Äî no monitoring; you‚Äôre available on
                request.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Principle: each successful pass earns less HOW next time.</p>
            <h3>Example: ‚ÄúSell more to Scotland‚Äù</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Vague instruction (bad): ‚ÄúSell more to Scotland.‚Äù<br />
                ‚Äî Confuses Tell/Delegate; gives no constraints or support.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tell version: ‚ÄúSell more to Scotland. Open Glasgow and
                Edinburgh, build a tartan site, hire a manager, buy a
                copier.‚Äù<br />
                ‚Äî You‚Äôre prescribing the HOW.
              </li>
              <li>
                Good Delegation: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre best for this. Objective: +20% revenue
                in Scotland in 12 months. Budget: ¬£60k. Decision rights: up to
                ¬£5k per decision; above that, check with me. Check-ins: monthly.
                Risks: brand compliance.‚Äù<br />
                ‚Äî You set WHAT, constraints, cadence. They design the HOW.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tapering over time: Next year Wales (fewer HOW hints) ‚Üí later
                Ireland (‚ÄúAll yours; same guardrails‚Äù).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Fit with Tannenbaum &amp; Schmidt and Banana</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Tannenbaum &amp; Schmidt: the tree is you moving from Tell
                toward Delegate by shrinking HOW guidance as capability shows
                up. You can ‚Äúgo straight across‚Äù on repetitive missions by
                reducing HOW rather than stopping at every intermediate style
                meeting.
              </li>
              <li>
                Situational Leadership: as competence rises, your style shifts
                from Tell/Coach to Involve/Delegate. The tree is the
                micro‚Äëmechanism of that shift.
              </li>
              <li>
                Banana of Boredom: as they master the HOW, inject a new stretch
                (new metric, constraint, scope) before boredom bends performance
                down. Keep them in learning mode without yanking away autonomy.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Leader actions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Define WHAT crisply: outcome, success metrics, why it matters.
              </li>
              <li>
                State guardrails: budget/time/quality limits; decision rights;
                reporting cadence.
              </li>
              <li>
                Remove HOW unless safety/risk requires it; if you must give HOW,
                give less each cycle.
              </li>
              <li>
                Inspect outcomes, not methods; praise craft and judgment;
                capture lessons at review.
              </li>
              <li>
                Time the next stretch to pre‚Äëempt boredom (banana prevention).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Q&A</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Can I skip Consult/Share entirely? For repeatable missions with
                a proven person, yes ‚Äî reduce HOW instead of running full
                shared‚Äëplanning rituals each time. Use Consult/Share when the
                problem is ambiguous or you need broad buy‚Äëin.
              </li>
              <li>
                What if they ask for HOW? Give principles, examples, and risks ‚Äî
                not step‚Äëby‚Äëstep. Ask them to propose a plan first.
              </li>
              <li>
                When is HOW still needed? High risk, compliance‚Äëcritical tasks,
                or genuine novices. Even then, taper as quickly as safety
                allows.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>One-line summary</h3>
            <p>
              Earn the right to delegate by shrinking the HOW each round ‚Äî clear
              WHAT + guardrails, less HOW every time, then add fresh stretch to
              avoid the banana.
